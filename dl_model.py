# 1) apply this simple deep learning classifier  method https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/docs/2015_acl_dan.pdf
#  2) apply this convolution method https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882
#  3) come up with a method to do better than these.
    # try applying a novel dropout-inspired regularizer: http://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-regularization-deep-learning-models-keras/
    # for each training instance, randomly drop some of the tokens' embeddings before computing the average.

# Classifies reviews using an unordered (i.e not syntactic) deep model: the deep averaging network (DAN)




#
# The DAN-ROOT model only has access to sentence-level labels for SST experiments, while all other models are trained on labeled phrases (if they exist) in addition to sentences.
# Trained using adaGrad



# Do regular DAN in tf and in np
# Add convolution to the script
# Read the dl paper
